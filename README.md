# Fantasy-Football-Optimizer

## Description:
This is R code using rvest, dplyr googlesheets packages and Selector Gadget to scrape html data from daily fantasy websites such as Draft Kings or FanDuel and store collected data into a google sheets linear optimizer model.

## Optimization Model
The optimization model is a straight linear optimization that calculates the best use of resources given budget constraints and expected player values. 
Player values are calculated by the fantasy football website themselves and scraped into the model

## Disclaimer:
This is just the R code that scrapes, manipulates and stores fantasy data from websites and pushes into Google Sheets
The optimization model is a contained within a google sheet that is not currently public. 

Thanks,
